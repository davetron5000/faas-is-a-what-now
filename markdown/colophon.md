This book is written in a modified version of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), processed by [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) using a system I created called [Bookdown](https://github.com/davetron5000/bookdown). It allows me to write text and code together, such that when the Markdown source is processed, the code examples execute.  It's sort of like a reverse of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

The headers are set in Helvetica Neue, defaulting to the system sans-serif if not available.  The body text is set in
Georgia, falling back to  the system serif font.

Code is set in Monaco or Lucida Console, depending on your operating system, with syntax highlighting provided by [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org).

Thanks for reading!
